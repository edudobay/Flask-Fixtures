    test_persist_fixtures
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    A set of tests for checking the `persist_fixtures` feature of Flask-
    Fixtures. The default behavior for Fixtures is to completely destroy and
    rebuild the database from scratch for each individual test. This is
    typically preferred, since it limits the number of false negatives by
    making sure that each test runs independently, and is therefore not
    affected by previous tests. However, if there is a need to run a set of
    tests without a complete refresh of the test fixtures (e.g., for
    performance reasons), the `persist_fixtures` flag can be set to `True` to
    do so. This set of tests makes sure that the `persist_fixtures` flag works
    as expected.
